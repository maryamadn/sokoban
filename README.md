## Responsiveness
Basic CSS was used to ensure responsiveness across devices/screens. There are differences in layout/sizes at screen widths of 400px and below, between 401px and 650px, and above 650px.

## Coding Logic
I would like to share a snippet of the logic involved in creating this game. The most important thing to consider is the restrictions in movement.
As per the rules, players can move in 4 directions as long as they are not blocked by walls. They can also push a coin that is not blocked by another coin or a wall.
Hence, before any movement is made, 2 things need to be checked.

- The following point that the player moves to:
  - It must not be a wall.
  - If it is a coin, the point after the coin must not be a coin or a wall.
  
Once everything is checked and if the movement is not restricted, 3 points will change. The preceding point will change to the point that the player was in previously.
The player point will change to the point that the following point was. Lastly, the following point will take the new point that is after it.

## End Remarks

This is my first game that I made that can be visualised and is deployed through Vercel. Although it took me a while to sort out the logic behind the game, it has been worth it!
I truly enjoyed figuring out how to display the level maps and set the movement restrictions. Creating this puzzle was a delightful puzzle in itself. If you have tried my game,
I hope you enjoyed it as well. If there are any enquiries at all or feedbacks, please do contact me at maryamahmaddahlan@gmail.com. Thank you and have a nice day!
